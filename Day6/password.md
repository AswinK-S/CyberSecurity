**.Identify best practices for creating strong passwords.**

  To create strong passwords, make them long (at least 12-16 characters), random (mix uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols), and unique (different for every account). Avoid using personal information, common words, or easily guessable patterns. You can use a password manager to generate and securely store complex passwords, or create a memorable passphrases using a unique phrase, like a song lyric or book quote, and then add numbers and symbols.

  **.Write down tips learned from the evaluation**

  ‚úÖ Best Practices

Length Matters ‚Üí Use at least 12‚Äì16 characters (the longer, the stronger).

Mix It Up ‚Üí Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters (! @ # $ % ^ & *).

Avoid Common Words ‚Üí Don‚Äôt use names, birthdays, ‚Äú123456,‚Äù ‚Äúpassword,‚Äù or keyboard patterns (qwerty, abcd).

Passphrases Work Well ‚Üí Create a phrase from random words, e.g. "Sun!Train99_PurpleSky". Easy to remember, hard to guess.

Unique Per Account ‚Üí Never reuse the same password across multiple accounts.

Don‚Äôt Share Passwords ‚Üí Keep them private and avoid writing them down in plain text.

Use a Password Manager ‚Üí Tools like Bitwarden, 1Password, or LastPass can generate and store strong passwords securely.

Enable 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) ‚Üí Adds an extra layer of security, even if your password is leaked.

‚ùå What to Avoid

Pet names, family names, or favorite sports teams.

Repeating characters ("aaaa1111").

Short passwords (under 8 characters).

Password reuse across sites.


***common password attacks***

1) Brute-force attack

What: Attacker tries every possible password until one works (often automated). 


Signs: Many failed login attempts from same IP or account; account lockout alerts.
Defenses: strong long passwords, rate limiting, account lockouts/throttling, MFA.

2) Dictionary attack

What: Tries words from a dictionary (common words, permutations) instead of every possible string. Often faster than pure brute force. 


Signs: Rapid attempts using real-word passwords.
Defenses: block common passwords, use password complexity/length, use breached-password checks.

3) Credential stuffing

What: Use lists of breached username/password pairs against many sites ‚Äî relies on password reuse. Very high-volume and automated. 


Signs: Successful logins from unfamiliar locations/IPs soon after a large breach; account takeover reports.
Defenses: unique passwords per site, password managers, MFA, monitoring for reused/breached credentials, bot-detection and IP reputation checks.

4) Password spraying

What: Attacker tries a small set of common passwords (e.g., Password1!) across many accounts to avoid lockouts. Effective against organizations with weak/default passwords. 


Signs: Many different accounts show single failed attempt from same IP range; low-and-slow login attempts.
Defenses: enforce strong passwords, detect abnormal authentication patterns, enable MFA, logon anomaly detection.

5) Phishing (and spear-phishing)

What: Trick users into revealing credentials (fake login pages, malicious links). Spear-phishing targets specific people. 


Signs: Unexpected emails asking to ‚Äúconfirm‚Äù credentials, login pages with odd URLs, sudden credential usage from new devices.
Defenses: user training, email filtering, link preview tools, MFA, browser/site-certificate checks.

6) Keyloggers / credential-stealer malware

What: Malware (or browser stealers) captures keystrokes, clipboard contents, or stored passwords. Recent reports show stealer malware and M-as-a-Service are increasingly common. 


Signs: Unusual processes on device, new accounts/transactions, credentials observed on dark web.
Defenses: endpoint protection/EDR, keep systems patched, avoid running untrusted binaries, use hardware MFA keys where possible.

7) Rainbow-table / precomputed hash attacks

What: Attacker uses precomputed tables to reverse common password hashes quickly (works when salts are absent or weak).
Signs: Offline compromise of hashed password database.
Defenses: salt + strong hashing (bcrypt/argon2/scrypt), slow hash settings, rotate/expire credentials after breaches.

8) Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)

What: Attacker intercepts traffic and steals credentials (e.g., on unsecured Wi-Fi) or via an intermediary server. 


Signs: Unexpected certificate errors, logins from odd IPs, user reports of strange network behavior.
Defenses: use HTTPS, HSTS, VPNs on untrusted networks, certificate pinning, MFA.

9) Shoulder-surfing / social engineering

What: Direct observation, phone scams, or impersonation to get credentials.
Signs: Someone asking for passwords/OTP, people looking over shoulders in public places.
Defenses: never disclose passwords/OTPs, privacy screens in public, security awareness training.

10) Hybrid attacks

What: Combine techniques (e.g., start with dictionary, then brute force on likely variants).
Defenses: multi-layered controls above + monitoring and incident response.

***summary***
Longer passwords ‚Üí exponentially increase the number of possible combinations, making brute-force attacks far slower.

Mix of characters (upper, lower, numbers, symbols) ‚Üí expands the character set, so attackers need to try many more possibilities.

Avoiding dictionary words & patterns ‚Üí reduces the risk of dictionary or common-password attacks.

Unique per account ‚Üí prevents credential stuffing when one password is leaked.

üëâ In short: the more complex and unique a password is, the harder it becomes for attackers to break it using automated methods.
