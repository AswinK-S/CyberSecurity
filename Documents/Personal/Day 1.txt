4. Potential security risk from open ports
1️⃣ 135/tcp – MSRPC (Microsoft Remote Procedure Call)

Purpose: Allows Windows programs and services to communicate over the network.

Potential Security Risks:

Exploitable vulnerabilities (e.g., the old Blaster/WannaCry attacks targeted RPC).

Attackers could attempt remote code execution if RPC is unpatched.

Mitigation:

Keep Windows updated with security patches.

Limit exposure to the local network only; don’t expose this port to the Internet.

2️⃣ 139/tcp – NetBIOS Session Service

Purpose: Used for Windows file and printer sharing (legacy protocol).

Potential Security Risks:

Can allow unauthorized file access if shares are misconfigured.

Can leak sensitive info (hostnames, usernames).

Target for malware spreading across local networks.

Mitigation:

Disable NetBIOS if not needed.

Use strong share permissions and firewall rules.

3️⃣ 445/tcp – Microsoft-DS (SMB over TCP)

Purpose: Modern Windows file sharing and Active Directory services.

Potential Security Risks:

SMB vulnerabilities are widely exploited (e.g., WannaCry, EternalBlue).

Exposing this port to the Internet is very dangerous.

Mitigation:

Keep systems patched.

Restrict access to trusted networks.

Consider disabling SMBv1 entirely.

4️⃣ 5432/tcp – PostgreSQL Database

Purpose: Database server listening for connections.

Potential Security Risks:

Open to the network → attackers can try brute-force login.

Misconfigured PostgreSQL may allow unauthorized access or data leakage.

Mitigation:

Ensure strong passwords for all DB users.

Allow connections only from trusted hosts.

Consider firewall rules to block unwanted access.

Encrypt database traffic (SSL/TLS).
